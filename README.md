# Customer Churn Analysis

## Objective
Analyze customer data to identify key factors that contribute to customer churn and to build a predictive model to identify customers at risk of leaving.

## Dataset
Telco Customer Churn dataset containing customer demographics, services, and billing information.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Project Structure
- data/: Raw and processed datasets
- notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks for analysis
- visuals/: Plots and charts

## Project Workflow
- Data Cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Insight generation

## Key Insights
- Month-to-Month contracts have highest Churn rates
- Short tenure strongly correlates with churn
- High monthly charges increase churn risk


## Machine Learning
BUilt a baseline logistic regression model to predict customer churn. Model evaluation using accuracy. confusion matrix, and classification report showed strong [erformance for non-churn prediction and reasonable churn detection, establishing a foundation for further model refinement.
